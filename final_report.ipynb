        "Lots of people come to Kolkata for job or educational purposeses and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",

To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",

Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Kolkata has been one of on the rise.\n",

        "In this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the neighborhood into 5 different clusters and for 144 different lattitude and logitude from dataset, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average house prices and school rating have been made.\n",

This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n",

Best means on the basis of all required things(daily needs or things we need to live a better life around and also in terms of cost effective.But there is not enough data about schools and hospitals in foursquare api for the location Kolkata. so thinkking to use google maps api for getting the best results.\n",
